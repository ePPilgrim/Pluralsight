4. To make my ASP.NET application (BethanyPieShop) be accessed globaly, following simple steps should be done:
i) Cread DB storage on the Azure Cloud - Azure SQL data base + Azure SQL server;
ii) From VS migrate DB to the Cloud DB: use utitlity of entity framework add-migration + update-databse. But in this scenario only tables and initial records are being migreted to new Azure SQL DB.
