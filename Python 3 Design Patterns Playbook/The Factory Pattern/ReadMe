To implement Factory pattern introspection is utilized;
There is difference between introspection and reflection. The last one is about modified object by its metadata;
Interface classes in python are inhereted from abc.ABC class;
All methods in interface class must be decorated with  @abc.abstractmethod decorators;
All packages in python contains optional init file __init__.py;
Locations used for searching imported modules are listed in configurable variable sys.path;
However the main purpos of Factory pattern is to make project to comply with Dependency Inversion principle. These two implementations ensure complience with Open/Close principle as well.
